                    <p>The Back-End of this site was built using python. First i created a django application just to render the views of the site,
                        the second part of this project was to create an API using really helpfull library called Flask. 
                        The last part of the website was the projects themself (ML models or Data Analysis projects).<br>

                        <li><b>Django views rendering:</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The site starts at home route that displays the landing page of the site, it has About content, resume content,
                            portfolio content and contact content. the portfolio have different projects in different topics, if you click any data anaysis project,
                            you will see an introduction and at the end of this introduction you could be redirected to the complete analysis, it could be Python or R code.
                         </p>
                        <li><b >Flask API:</b></li>
                        <p>
                            The Flask API was built to serve Machine Learning, Deep Learning or Fine Tuning projects, it does not have authentication code for simplicity
                            for people that does not have time to log in. There are different models uploaded and will be more in the future.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>ML models, and Data Analysis:</b></li>
                        <p>
                            All A.I models have been built using python and its dedicated libraries for Machine Learning and Deep learning. I have used jupyter notebooks also
                            to create and document all the steps needed to train the algorithms (you can find the code of these projects on my <a href="https://github.com/jchristian1">github</a>).
